generation.py

A tool to automatically generate question-answer datasets from source text using
various methods, including Large Language Models (LLMs) and rule-based NLP.

Usage:
  python generation.py --method <method_name> --input_file <path_to_file> [options]

Methods:
  - 'llm': Uses a Large Language Model (e.g., GPT-4) to generate Q&A pairs.
  - 'rule-based': Uses a set of NLP rules and patterns.
  - 'finetune': A placeholder for a future fine-tuning pipeline.

"""

# # Third-party library imports (you would install these with pip)
# # For the 'llm' method
# from openai import OpenAI  # Or another LLM library like 'ollama'
# we can either use a self-hosted model here or just use OpenAI models

# # For the 'rule-based' method
# import spacy
# nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
